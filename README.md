# WASM_STUFF

This repo contains projects in the Kevin Hoffman Book.  
1. Checkers game implemented in raw wat. Unlike in the book, this one has more features. (challenge given in the book)
2. Checkers game implemented in Rust-wasm.
3. A chat Application
4. Others (I am yet to reach those other chapters)

## WHY?
wasm might be the future of packaging truly portable software. Software that runs on any device. I see this as a basis for writing durable software.  
It is like the final abstraction we need before venturing into programming matter.  

So I begin here, understanding wasm on embedded devices... we will then move on to real matter... hopefully.
