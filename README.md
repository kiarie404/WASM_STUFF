# WASM_STUFF

This repo contains wasm sample code that I may reference in the future.  

## WHY?
wasm might be a viable choice for packaging software in a portable way, simple way without a lot of boiler-plate-technical clutter.  
Software that runs on any device OR on top of other system-software in a standard and constant way.   
I see this as a basis for writing durable software.  


It is like the final abstraction we need before venturing into programming matter.  

So I begin here, understanding wasm on embedded devices... we will then move on to real matter... hopefully.
